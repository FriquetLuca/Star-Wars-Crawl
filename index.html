                <p>Since I've started working on a lot of exercices in BeCode, I've met a bunch of people.</p>
                <p>We all share a lot of common interest and we helped each other a lot when someone encounter a problem. So far so good.</p>
                <p>The coach all tried their best to cheer thoses who struggle and the motivation is usually quite high. Still nothing problematic appearing except the fact that we sometimes need to rush some exercices instead of taking our sweet time so we can stay in track.</p>
